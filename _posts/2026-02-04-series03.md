# ⚽ U10 SESSION PLAN: AGILITY & BALL CONTROL
**Topic:** *Speed of Reaction & Dribbling Mastery*   **Total Duration:** *60 Minutes*
### 📋 COACH’S PROTOCOL: **The “Side‑Line Reset”**

If a player uses “not‑so‑cool” words or stops following instructions, use the **2‑Minute Reset Rule**.

**How to explain it to the kids:**

> “Team, to have the most fun, we need to respect our teammates and the game.  
> If you use bad words or forget the rules, you’ll take a *2‑Minute Reset* on the sideline.  
> This isn’t a punishment — it’s just 120 seconds to catch your breath, refocus,  
> and come back ready to play like a pro!”

**⏱ Time:** 10 Minutes  

### **Organization**
- Each player has a ball inside a grid.

### **How the Drill Works**

- **“Pinky!”** – outside of the foot  

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Pinky toe touches!”** – Light, controlled touches.
