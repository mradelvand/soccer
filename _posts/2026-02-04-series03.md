## 📋 COACH’S PROTOCOL: **The “Side‑Line Reset”**

If a player uses “not‑so‑cool” words or stops following instructions, use the **2‑Minute Reset Rule**.

**How to explain it to the kids:**

> “Team, to have the most fun, we need to respect our teammates and the game.  
> If you use bad words or forget the rules, you’ll take a *2‑Minute Reset* on the sideline.  
> This isn’t a punishment — it’s just 120 seconds to catch your breath, refocus,  
> and come back ready to play like a pro!”
