# Session 2 — 1‑Hour Soccer Training Plan (Ages 8–10)  
**Players:** 12  
**Balls:** 4  
**Theme:** *Passing + scanning + support angles → small‑group play → game* (small‑sided environments increase involvement and touches). [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

> **Coach objective:** Keep it fun, competitive, and organized with minimal waiting by running **four ball-stations at once** and using fast rotations. [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

## Session at a glance (60 minutes)
- **Phase 1 (20 min):** Technical warm-up — **Pass & Move Through Gates** → **3v1 Rondo** (same stations, same balls). [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)[3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)  
- **Phase 2 (20 min):** Competitive application — **2v2 FUNiño to 4 small goals** (decision-making, combination play). [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  
- **Phase 3 (15 min):** Small-sided game — **4v4** (simple constraints to encourage spacing). [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)[5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)  
- **Phase 4 (5 min):** Wrap-up — reflection + positive reinforcement (age‑appropriate confidence building).

## Non‑negotiable coaching rules (say once, use all hour)
### Attention signal
**Coach script (10 seconds):**  
> “When I say **FREEZE**: stop, eyes on me, mouth closed.”  
(If holding a ball: “foot on the ball.”)

This creates a clear routine and supports a positive learning environment for kids in this stage. [6](https://quickstartsoccer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Passing-Drill-Pass-Through-The-Gate.pdf)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

### “Show, don’t tell”
Every new activity = **3‑second demo** + **1 sentence rule**, then play (kids learn visually and stay engaged). [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

---

## Field setup (do this before players arrive)
### Equipment
- 4 balls, ~20 cones, bibs optional. (Station-based setups help keep everyone active.) [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

### Layout
Create **4 stations** (A–D), each a **15x20 yard** mini-area with **5 gates** (10 cones) spread out. [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)  
Also mark:
- 2 FUNiño fields (Phase 2)  
- 1 4v4 field (Phase 3)  

> **Pitch size note:** 4v4 can be played on roughly **12m x 20m to 15m x 25m** depending on age/space (adjust as needed). [5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)

---

## Grouping & rotation (12 kids / 4 balls = no long lines)
Make **4 groups of 3 players** (G1–G4).  
- Each group has **1 ball** at one station.  
- Everyone is active at once (max touches, minimal waiting). [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

Within each group of 3, rotate roles every 45–60 seconds:
- **Passer / Receiver / Mover** (keeps movement constant). [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)

---

# Phase 1 (20 minutes): Technical Warm‑Up — Passing, Movement & Awareness
**Goal:** Build “pass → move → scan” habits first, then add a defender (rondo) for decision-making. [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)[3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)

## Phase 1 scoring (use for BOTH activities)
Use a simple competition layer:
- **5 points = Perfect** (clean pass + clean receive + correct rule followed)  
- **3 points = Functional** (one mistake: heavy touch, small bobble, but still completes)

This encourages effort, adds fun, and keeps focus without overemphasizing “winning.” [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)[6](https://quickstartsoccer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Passing-Drill-Pass-Through-The-Gate.pdf)

---

## Phase 1A (10 min): **Pass & Move Through Gates** (3v0)
**Source drill concept:** Score by passing through a gate to a teammate; cannot use the same gate repeatedly; move off the ball; scan for space. [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)[7](https://www.soccerdrive.com/soccer-drills/pass-and-move-gates)

### Setup
In each group’s station:
- 5 cone-gates scattered
- 3 players with 1 ball

### Rules (simple)
- Team scores **1 point** when a pass goes **through a gate** and teammate receives it. [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)  
- **Cannot** score in the same gate twice in a row. [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)  
- Passer must **move** to a new space immediately after passing. [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)  

### Time plan (10 minutes)
1. **2 min** — teach + demo (3 seconds)  
2. **3 x 2‑minute rounds** with **20 seconds reset** between rounds  
   - Round 1: 2-touch max  
   - Round 2: 1-touch if possible (or “as few touches as you can”)  
   - Round 3: “Weak foot only” challenge (optional)

### 5/3 scoring details
- **5 pts**: pass splits gate + first touch stays controlled + player moves immediately  
- **3 pts**: pass splits gate but receive needs extra touch OR pass slightly off line but still successful  

### Coach short instruction (say this)
> “Score by passing **through** a gate to your teammate.  
> **Pass and MOVE**—no standing.  
> You can’t use the same gate twice in a row. GO!” [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)

### Quick fixes (exact words)
- Players standing: **“Pass → MOVE. If you pass and watch, you lose points.”** [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)  
- Bad angles: **“Get off the same line—make a triangle.”** (support angles = easier passes). [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)[3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)  
- Rushing: **“Slow to be accurate—accuracy scores.”** [2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)  

---

## Phase 1B (10 min): **3v1 Rondo** (keep away with one defender)
**Why:** Rondos are a game-like way to train passing, receiving, scanning, and quick decisions; 3v1 is a simple stepping stone. [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

### Setup
- Same 4 groups of 3 become **4 groups of 4**?  
We’ll do this cleanly with 12 players:
- Run **3 rondos** at once (3v1) using **3 balls**  
- The extra group does a **2v1 keep-away in a small triangle** using the 4th ball (still rondo-like)  
Rotate groups every 2 minutes so everyone plays 3v1. [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

> If you prefer simplicity: run **4 small 3v1 boxes**, but you’d need 16 players. With 12, the rotation approach keeps it practical. [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

### Rules
- 3 players keep possession vs 1 defender  
- If defender wins it or ball goes out → defender swaps with player who lost it. [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)  

### Time plan (10 minutes)
- **4 x 2‑minute games**, **20 seconds** to rotate defenders / swap groups

### 5/3 scoring (kid-friendly)
Give each attacking team a “target”:
- **5 pts** = **5 completed passes in a row** (count out loud)  
- **3 pts** = **3 completed passes in a row**  
Reset count if defender touches the ball.

### Coach short instruction (say this)
> “Three keep the ball. One wins it.  
> If you lose it, you’re defender.  
> Count your passes—5 passes = **5 points**!” [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

### One coaching cue at a time (don’t overload)
Pick one per round:
- “**Open your body**” (receive sideways) [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)  
- “**Look before you get it**” (scan) [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)  
- “**Move after you pass**” (support) [3](https://www.sportsessionplanner.com/s/O5JLh/Rondo-3v1.html)[2](https://soccersourcecoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pass-and-Move-through-the-gates-drill.pdf)

# Phase 2 (20 minutes): Competitive Application — **2v2 FUNiño to 4 Goals**
**Why:** 2v2 with four goals naturally creates width, scanning, quick transitions, and fun finishing choices. [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)[8](https://play.advance.football/pages/funino)

## Setup
Create **two FUNiño fields** (so 8 players play at once):
- Each field ~**20x30 yards** with **4 small goals** (two on each end line). [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  
- 1 ball per field (2 balls active), spare balls with coach for fast restarts. [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  

## Organization (12 players)
- Field 1: 4 players (2v2) + 2 waiting to rotate in  
- Field 2: 4 players (2v2) + 2 waiting to rotate in  
Rotate every **90 seconds** so nobody sits long.

## Rules (simple)
- Score in either of the two attacking goals. [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  
- If ball out or goal → new ball immediately from coach (fast tempo). [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  

## Time plan (20 minutes)
- **2 min** explain + demo
- **8 x 2‑minute rounds** (with 15 seconds to rotate pairs)

## Competitive scoring
- Team goal = 1 point  
- Bonus: “**2 points** if you score after a **1‑2 pass** (give-and-go).” (promotes combination play described in coaching points). [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)

## Coach short instruction (say this)
> “Two goals to attack—scan and pick the easier one!  
> Win it, pass or dribble, and finish fast!” [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)

## Quick fixes (exact words)
- Players dribble into traffic: **“Look—other goal might be open!”** [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  
- Two attackers separate: **“Stay connected—help your teammate.”** [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)  
- Defenders both chase: **“One presses, one covers.”** (basic defensive communication emphasis). [4](https://soccerxpert.com/drills/details/2v2-with-4-small-goals)

# Phase 3 (15 minutes): Small‑Sided Game — **4v4** (with simple constraints)
**Why:** Small-sided games increase involvement and touches, and 4v4 is a strong developmental format. [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)[5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)

## Setup
- 4v4 field using recommended flexibility (roughly **12m x 20m to 15m x 25m** depending on space). [5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)  
- Remaining 4 players become **sideline neutrals** (2 each side), 2-touch max, rotate every 3 minutes.

## Constraint (keep it easy for 8–10)
- **1 point** for a goal  
- **2 points** for a goal if the team makes a pass to a sideline neutral first (encourages width & switching). [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)[5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)

## Time plan (15 minutes)
- **2 min** explain + assign neutrals  
- **10 min** play (rotate neutrals every 3 minutes)  
- **3 min** “free play” (remove constraint)

## Coach short instruction
> “Use your neutral helpers on the side—2 touches only.  
> If you score after using a neutral, it’s **2 points**!” [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)[5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)

# Phase 4 (5 minutes): Wrap‑Up & Reflection
**Goal:** End with confidence and clear “what we learned” (important at this age). [6](https://quickstartsoccer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Passing-Drill-Pass-Through-The-Gate.pdf)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

## 30‑second cool down
Light jog → stop → breathe.

## 3 quick awards (rotate weekly)
- Best Effort  
- Bravest Try  
- Best Teammate  

**Coach script:**
> “What did you get better at today—passing, moving, or scanning?  
> I saw brave tries and great teamwork. Well done!” [6](https://quickstartsoccer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Passing-Drill-Pass-Through-The-Gate.pdf)[1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)
