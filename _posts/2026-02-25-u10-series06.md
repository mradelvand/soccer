# ⚽ U10 SESSION PLAN: DEFENDING TECHNIQUES
**Topic:** *1v1 Defensive Principles & Small-Sided Application*  
**Total Duration:** *60 Minutes*

---

# 1. WARM-UP GAME: 2v2 Free Play (Defensive Awareness Activation)  
**⏱ Time:** 15 Minutes  

### **Organization**
- 20m × 15m field  
- Two small goals  
- Multiple 2v2 games running  
- Coach positioned on the sideline observing  

### **How the Drill Works**
- Free-flowing 2v2 games.
- Let players play naturally.
- Begin introducing basic defending language during play:
  - “Close the space!”
  - “Side on!”
  - “Don’t dive in!”

### **Coaching Focus**
Introduce the concept of **1v1 defending inside the game**, not in isolation.

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Fast… Slow… Side… Low!”**
As the defender get closer to ball carrier **fast**, have to slow down so fast, **to close the distance slow**
the defender need to be **side** , shoulder is facing the attacker, the body should be **low**

# 2. TECHNICAL: 1v1 Approach Mechanics  
**⏱ Time:** 10 Minutes  

### **Organization**
- 15m channel  
- One attacker with ball  
- One defender  
- Rotate roles every repetition  

### **How the Drill Works**
Defender works on proper approach mechanics:

1. **Fast** – Close the distance quickly.
2. **Slow** – Slow down as you get close.
3. **Side** – Body turned sideways (hips perpendicular).
4. **Low** – Bend knees, stay balanced.

Players repeat multiple 1v1 duels focusing ONLY on approach.

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Arrive under control!”**

# 3. TECHNICAL: Angle of Approach (Sideline is Your Friend)  
**⏱ Time:** 10 Minutes  

### **Organization**
- 20m × 15m field  
- Small goal in center  
- Start attacker in middle  
- Defender starts 5–7m away  

### **How the Drill Works**
- Defender must angle run to push attacker toward the sideline.
- Emphasize cutting space in half.
- If defender forces attacker wide → success.

### **Teaching Moment**
Ask players:

> “Who is the best defender in soccer history?”

Answer: **The Sideline.**  
It never gets beaten.

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Show them outside!”**

# 4. TECHNICAL: Jab, Don’t Stab  
**⏱ Time:** 10 Minutes  

### **Organization**
- 10m channel  
- 1 attacker vs 1 defender  
- Small gate or end line to score  

### **How the Drill Works**
Teach the difference:

❌ **Stab** – Lunging with back foot (unbalanced).  
✅ **Jab** – Poke with front foot while balanced.

### **Teach the 3 Jab Triggers**
Defenders may jab when:

1. Attacker takes a **bad touch**
2. Attacker’s **eyes are down**
3. They are in a **tight space**

Rotate players frequently.

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Jab with the front foot!”**
