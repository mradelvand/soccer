# 1. TECHNICAL: 1v1 Approach Mechanics  
**⏱ Time:** 10 Minutes  

### **Organization**
- 15m channel  
- One attacker with ball  
- One defender  
- Rotate roles every repetition  

### **How the Drill Works**
Defender works on proper approach mechanics:

1. **Fast** – Close the distance quickly.
2. **Slow** – Slow down as you get close.
3. **Side** – Body turned sideways (hips perpendicular).
4. **Low** – Bend knees, stay balanced.

Players repeat multiple 1v1 duels focusing ONLY on approach.

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Arrive under control!”**

**“Fast… Slow… Side… Low!”**

As the defender get closer to ball carrier **fast**, have to slow down so fast, **to close the distance slow**
the defender need to be **side** , shoulder is facing the attacker, the body should be **low**

**Angle of Approach (Sideline is Your Friend)**
***What angle you are going to take towards the ball carrier ?*** The angle that push attcker ouside of the field / sideline.

### **Coaching Cue**
**“Show them outside!”**
