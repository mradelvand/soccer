### Phase 1 – First Half  
**Ball Possession & Build-Up:**  
Smooth two-touch play kept control and dictated tempo.  

**Final Third:**  
Created several good chances — Step and Theo/Dex consistently threatened the defense.  

**Defense (Deep):**  
The CB/HM shield worked well, but full backs (RB/LB) were slower recovering on counters, leading to a late goal and a 2–1 deficit just before halftime.  

**Takeaway:**  
Improve flank discipline and maintain focus when defending in the closing minutes of each half.  

---

### Phase 2 – Second Half Adjustments  
**Tactic:**  
Shifted from 1 CB / 2 WB to 2 CB / 1 W for stronger central cover and more aggressive pressing.  

**Result:**  
Scored from a corner. Dexter (W) attacked the second post perfectly — leveling it 2–2.  

**Takeaways:**  
- Wide defenders must force opponents wide and recover quickly.  
- Maintain total focus in danger moments (five minutes before and after halves).  
- Work on shooting accuracy to convert more chances.

## Main Takeaway Drill: Keep the Attacker Wide  

This drill helps defenders control play by steering attackers away from goal and into the wide areas. It reduces dangerous shots and gives teammates time to recover and support.  

### The Setup  
- **Area:** Half pitch  
- **Equipment:** 3 cones, 2 balls, 1 goal  

### How It Works  
1. The defender starts by passing the ball diagonally into a wide area to simulate a game scenario.

2. As soon as the ball moves, both the defender and attacker race toward it — the defender aiming to recover first and get between the attacker and goal.  
3. The defender pressures the attacker quickly, staying goalside and guiding play along the touchline rather than letting the attacker cut inside.

### Key Coaching Calls  
- “Keep play in wide areas!”  
- “Stay on your feet!”  
- “Block the cross or shot!”
