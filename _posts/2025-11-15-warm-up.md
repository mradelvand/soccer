## Warm-Up Phase I: Low-Intensity Movement & Activation

### 1. Forward Jog → Backward Jog
- **Repetitions:** 2  
- **Focus:** Basic locomotion and balance  

**Coach's Instruction:**  
"Okay team, let's start with a simple jog! Jog forward from **Cone 1 to Cone 4**. Once you reach Cone 4, turn around and **jog backward** back to Cone 1. Keep it smooth and light! We'll do that **twice**."

### 2. Shuffle Right → Shuffle Left
- **Repetitions:** 2  
- **Focus:** Lateral movement and footwork  

**Coach's Instruction:**  
"Now let's move side to side. Start **facing the sideline**. Shuffle to Cone 4, leading with your right shoulder. When you reach Cone 4, turn around — stay facing the sideline — and **shuffle back to Cone 1**, this time leading with your left shoulder. Keep those feet moving fast and stay low!"
