# Session — Reaction, Feint & Play Fast (Ages 8–10)
**Players:** 12  
**Balls:** Plenty (ideally 1 per player for the ball variation)  
**Theme:** *React → fake/turn → dribble/pass at speed → compete → play*

Short competitive rounds keep kids engaged and maximize involvement. Small‑sided games increase touches and decision-making. [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)

## Phase 0 (3 min): Coach opening + safety rules
### Coach Talk
> “Today we’re training **speed + clever turns + quick passing**.  
> We’ll do short competitions—everyone gets many turns.  
> When I say **FREEZE**: stop, eyes on me.” 

### Safety rules (say this clearly)
> “No pushing, no slide tackles, and heads up—watch your space.”

---

# Phase 1 (10 min): Drill #1 — React, Sprint & Find Your Corner
**Goal:** Dynamic warm-up + reaction + competitiveness. [2](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2P4PUK49IIg)  

## Setup
- Mark a **20x20** square with cones.
- Place **4 different colors** in the corners.
- Each player holds a cone matching one corner color (or wears a bib color).

## Drill flow
1. All players start in the center in an athletic stance.
2. Coach calls a movement (examples below) for 5–8 seconds.
3. Coach signals **“GO!”** → players sprint to their **matching color corner**.
4. Last 1–2 players each round do a fun penalty: **3 jumping jacks** (not push-ups).

### Warm-up movements (coach chooses)
- A-skips
- Butt kicks
- Open/close the gate
- Jumping jacks
- Side shuffle

## Time plan (10 minutes)
- **1 min** demo + safety
- **6 rounds x 60 sec** (5–8 sec movement + sprint + reset)
- **1 min** “final round” = double points

## Competition scoring (optional)
- **First 3 players** to correct corner = **1 point each**
- **Last 2 players** = **0 points** + quick penalty
- Final round = **double points**

## Coach instructions (motivating + clear)
> “Stay light on your feet—small fast steps!  
> When I say GO, explode to YOUR corner—eyes up!” [3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2P4PUK49IIg)  

## Safety cue (say every round)
> “No cutting across someone—take a safe line and avoid collisions.” [3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2P4PUK49IIg)  

## If you see X → say Y
- Kids collide: **“Wider route—safety first, speed second!”**
- Kids start early: **“Wait for GO—reaction wins today.”**

# Phase 2 (10 min): Drill #2 — Fake, Turn & Sprint (Tag Battle)
**Goal:** Competitive turning + acceleration + defensive reaction.[3](https://youtube.com/shorts/zAofsUnGG1M?si=jaiLE40EKkF6zTMr)

## Setup
- Create **two 20x20 squares** side-by-side.
- Split players into **4 groups of 3** (two groups per square).
- Put **1 cone in the middle** of each square.

## Drill flow (Version A — no ball, 5 minutes)
1. Two players start at opposite corners (one attacker, one defender).
2. On coach signal, both sprint toward the middle cone.
3. **Attacker** performs a **fake + turn** and sprints to the far line.
4. **Defender** tries to **tag** attacker (tag = light touch on shoulder/back only).

### How to decide the winner
- If attacker reaches line without tag = attacker wins round
- If defender tags = defender wins round

## Drill flow (Version B — with ball, 5 minutes)
Same setup, but now:
- Attacker dribbles to middle cone, performs a feint/turn, and escapes.
- Defender wins by **touching the ball** (not tackling hard).

## Time plan (10 minutes)
- **1 min** demo + safety
- **Version A:** 4 rounds x 45 sec (rotate roles fast) = ~5 min
- **Version B:** 4 rounds x 45 sec (rotate roles fast) = ~5 min

## Fairness rule (important)
Everyone must be **attacker and defender** the same number of times.

## Competition scoring (per pair)
- Attacker win = 1 point for attacker’s team
- Defender win = 1 point for defender’s team
- First team to **5 points** wins the square

## Coach instructions (motivating)
> “Attackers: sell the fake—then explode!  
> Defenders: quick feet—stay balanced—touch the ball, don’t crash.”  

## Safety cues (say this)
> “Tag is a soft touch only. No pushing.  
> Defenders: stay on feet—no sliding.” 

## If you see X → say Y
- Defender dives in: **“Stay patient—shuffle, then touch the ball.”**
- Attacker stops dead: **“Quick-slow-quick—fake then accelerate!”**

# Phase 3 (12 min): Drill #3 — Zig‑Zag Feint + Pass Relay Race (Team Race)
**Goal:** Change of direction mechanics + feint at speed + passing accuracy + teamwork. Zig‑zag cutting emphasizes sharp direction changes and acceleration. [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42mdVEzUCU4)  

## Setup (same two 20x20 squares)
In each square:
- 4 corner cones + 1 center cone
- 2 teams of 3 players (Team A + Team B)
- 1 ball per team

## Drill flow (race format)
Each team runs the same pattern continuously:

1. Player dribbles **diagonally** from corner to the **center cone**.
2. At center: perform a **feint/turn** (body feint, inside cut, outside cut).
3. Pass to teammate waiting at the next corner.
4. Receiver takes first touch out, dribbles around the outside edge to the opposite corner.
5. Pass to next player, repeat.

## Time plan (12 minutes)
- **2 min** demo + walk-through (no speed yet)
- **4 races x 2 min** with **30 sec rest** and quick coaching

## Race scoring (more competition)
Each 2-minute race:
- **1 point** for each clean completed circuit pass sequence (coach counts aloud)
- **Bonus +2 points** if a team completes **3 clean circuits in a row** with no lost ball
- Winning team each race earns **+3 scoreboard points**

## Coach instructions (motivating)
> “Clean first touch, then go!  
> At the center cone: fake big, then accelerate.  
> Pass sharp to feet—help your teammate win.” [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42mdVEzUCU4)  

## Safety cues (say this)
> “Only ONE player at the center cone at a time—no collisions.  
> Keep your head up when you dribble around the outside.” [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42mdVEzUCU4)  

## If you see X → say Y
- Passes too hard: **“Pass to feet—partner control is the goal.”**
- Players cut into traffic: **“Stay wide—use the outside lane for safety.”**

# Phase 4 (20 min): Competitive Game — “Corner Score 4v4”
**Goal:** Use the day’s theme in a game: scan, switch, attack corners, react fast.  
Small-sided games help kids get more involved and learn through repetition. [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)  

## Setup
- Play **4v4** on a small field (adjust to your space).  
- Recommended 4v4 dimensions can be around **12m x 20m to 15m x 25m** depending on age/space. [5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)  
- Put **4 corner scoring zones** (a 2x2 yard square or a cone gate in each corner).

## Rules
- You score **1 point** by dribbling under control into any corner zone.
- You score **2 points** if the point comes after a **switch** (ball goes from one side to the other).
- Restart quickly with coach serving a new ball when it goes out.

## Time plan (20 minutes)
- **2 min** explain rules + demo corner scoring
- **3 games x 5 min** with **1 min rest/rotate subs**
- **Last 2 min:** “Golden Time” = all points double

## Coach instructions (motivating)
> “Heads up—find an open corner!  
> If it’s crowded, switch sides—then attack fast!” [1](https://www.usyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2023/09/The-Complete-Guide-To-Small-Sided-Games.pdf)[5](https://www.safa.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AnnexA-Laws_of_the_game.pdf)  

## Safety cues
> “No hard tackles, stay on your feet, and slow down near corners.” [2](https://washingtonyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/US_Youth_Small_Sided_Games_Manual_2017_3-22-18.pdf)  

## If you see X → say Y
- Everyone chases the ball: **“Spread out—one wide option!”**
- Kids camp in corners: **“No goal-hanging—corners must be earned by movement.”**

# Phase 5 (5 min): Wrap‑up + awards + reflection
This age group benefits from positive, visible feedback and confidence-safe praise. [2](https://washingtonyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/US_Youth_Small_Sided_Games_Manual_2017_3-22-18.pdf)  

## Awards (fast)
