### About Me: IT Engineering Discipline Meets Football Passion

Hey, I'm **Reza**. You might see the Master's in Computer Engineering and my +x years as a Network Engineer in my CV, but honestly, **football is where my heart is**. I believe the game is a language, and my goal is to coach with the same systematic discipline and commitment I used in my engineering.
#### Why I Coach
I grew up in **Khouzestan, Iran**—often called *"The Brazil of Iran."* Football is life there. My passion runs deep, inspired by my dad (a former soccer player) and shaped by training in the academy of an **Iran Federation A Licence Coach** from a young age.
#### My Commitment
I didn’t just walk into coaching; I **built it**. I spent **two years** as a volunteer Assistant Coach with the **Concordia Reserved Men's Team in Montreal**, demonstrating my dedication. For me, coaching is a **career commitment**, not a hobby.

I am focused on the future: currently pursuing my **Canada Soccer C Diploma (C Licence)** and actively improving my **French**. I bring **reliability, organization, and lifelong passion** to the field.

Let’s **build something great together!**
